          David Robert Jones was born in Brixton on January 8, 1947. At age 13,
          inspired by the jazz of the London West End, he picked up the
          saxophone and called up Ronnie Ross for lessons. Early bands he played
          with – The Kon-Rads, The King Bees, the Mannish Boys and the Lower
          Third –provided him with an introduction into the showy worlds of pop
          and mod, and by 1966 he was David Bowie, with long hair and
          aspirations of stardom rustling about his head. Kenneth Pitt signed on
          as his manager, and his career began with a handful of mostly
          forgotten singles and a head full of ideas. It was not until 1969 that
          the splash onto the charts would begin, with the legendary Space
          Oddity (which peaked at #5 in the UK). Amidst his musical wanderings
          in the late '60s, the young Bowie experimented with mixed media,
          cinema, mime, Tibetan Buddhism, acting and love. A first rock album,
          originally titled David Bowie then subsequently re-titled Man of
          Words, Man of Music and again as Space Oddity, paid homage to the
          kaleidoscopic influences of the London artistic scene, while hinting
          at a songwriting talent that was about to yield some of rock n roll's
          finest and most distinctive work--even if it would take the rest of
          the world a few years to catch up.

          Early 70s The Man Who Sold The World was the first David Bowie album
          recorded as an entity unto itself and marks ground zero of the first
          definitive creative stretch to come. Mick Ronson's guitars are often
          referred to as the birth point of heavy metal, and certainly the
          auspicious beginnings of glam rock can be traced here. The album was
          released by Mercury in April 1971 to minimal fanfare and Bowie took
          his first trip to the United States to promote it that spring. In May
          of the same year, Duncan Zowie Haywood Bowie was born to David and his
          then wife Angela.

          RCA was the next label to sign Bowie, and after a trip to America to
          complete the legalities, he returned to London to record two albums
          nearly back to back. Hunky Dory was built from a six-song demo that
          had enticed the label to sign him and features Changes and Life on
          Mars?. Almost immediately, it was followed by the instant classic The
          Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders from Mars—a record
          without which any Greatest Albums of All Time list is simply
          incomplete.
