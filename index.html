          The Man Who Sold The World was the first David Bowie album recorded as
          an entity unto itself and marks ground zero of the first definitive
          creative stretch to come. Mick Ronson's guitars are often referred to
          as the birth point of heavy metal, and certainly the auspicious
          beginnings of glam rock can be traced here.
